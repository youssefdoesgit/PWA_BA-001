/**
 * Three-way-ish merge for two copies of the ledger.
 *
 * Both devices edit freely offline, so this has to reconcile without a server
 * arbitrating. The rules are deliberately boring:
 *
 *   · records are unioned by id, never matched by content
 *   · when both sides have a record, the newer `updatedAt` wins outright
 *   · a tombstone is just another record, so deletions propagate like edits
 *
 * Boring is the point. Anything cleverer would occasionally resurrect a
 * deleted entry or silently drop one, and this is a ledger.
