/**
 * VANE's voice and judgement.
 *
 * The docket's unit, and deliberately nothing like BRIC. BRIC is staff: he
 * defers, he softens, he calls him sir. VANE is a colleague reading over your
 * notes — brisk, forward-facing, mildly impatient, and entirely uninterested
 * in flattering anyone. She reports what is closing and what has gone cold,
 * then gets out of the way.
 *
 * Fragments are intentional. So is the refusal to congratulate him for work he
 * has not finished.
 *
 * Like BRIC, every line is chosen by a real condition in the data. There is no
 * model here and no network call — this is rules over a local board.
